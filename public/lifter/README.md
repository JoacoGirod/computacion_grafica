# 3D Printer and Forklift Simulation

This interactive 3D simulation demonstrates a basic manufacturing and logistics system using Three.js. It includes a **3D printer**, **forklift**, **shelve**, and multiple **camera views**. You can interact with the simulation using keyboard controls and a GUI menu.

## 📦 Features

### 🖨️ 3D Printer

* The printer head **ascends gradually** as the model is generated layer by layer.
* Models are created using **Bezier or Catmull-Rom curves**.
* Supports two types of surface generation:

  * **Revolution surface**
  * **Sweep (extrusion) surface**
* The base mesh is generated incrementally and aligned with an invisible Three.js plane.

### 🚜 Forklift

* Operated with the keyboard.
* Can **pick up** and **drop objects** when close enough.
* Carried objects become part of the forklift group and move with it.
* Fork height is adjustable.
* **Wheels rotate** during movement and steering.
* Two more cars are available, Forklift and Zonda

### 🗄️ Shelves

* By default contains **2 levels** with **8 positions**, each with a small intermediary platform.
* Objects can be placed on shelves using a proximity-based system.

### 🎥 Cameras

Multiple cameras offer different perspectives:

| Key | Camera Type                                |
| --- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `1` | Orbital – general overview of the scene    |
| `2` | Orbital – focused on the 3D printer        |
| `3` | Orbital – focused on the shelf             |
| `4` | Driver View – first-person forklift camera |
| `5` | Follow Camera – behind the vehicle         |
| `6` | Side Camera – lateral vehicle follow view  |

| `D` | Rotate right               |
| `Q` | Raise fork (forklift only) |
| `E` | Lower fork (forklift only) |
| `G` | Grab or release object     |

### Vehicle Switching

| Key | Action             |
| --- | ------------------ |

| `Z` | Switch to Zonda    |

### Camera Zoom

| Key | Action             |
| --- | ------------------ |
| `O` | Zoom in (orbital)  |
| `P` | Zoom out (orbital) |
| `K` | Special zoom in    |
| `L` | Special zoom out   |

## ⚙️ GUI Menu Options

The scene includes a graphical menu to configure the 3D model generation:

* **Surface Type**

  * Revolution
  * Sweep (extrusion)
* **2D Shape for Revolution**

  * Options: A1, A2, A3, A4
* **2D Shape for Sweep**

  * Options: B1, B2, B3, B4
* **Twist Angle**

  * Applies rotational twisting to the model during generation.
* **Total Height**

  * Height of the printed element, must be less than the shelf height.
* **Total Width**

  * Width of the printer element.
* **Gen Steps**

  * Controls the number of segments in the surface generation.
* **Curve Steps**

  * Sets the number of samples used when drawing the curve.
