# Notes
Careful with generation on player position
Create more elements around the playable grid and make enough for the moving segments to take place
Model some items, maybe use blender or some dynamic tool that allows me to export or something
Add Lighting! would be nice to have a bright sun and some kind of shadows
Add some smoke or space dust
